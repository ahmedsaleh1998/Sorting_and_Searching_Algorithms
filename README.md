# Sorting_and_Searching_Algorithms

**this repo to build and create several types of searching and sorting algorithms by python programming language**
***searching algorithms.**

1) > *Sequentail search* :
   >
   > 1. in this algorithm we starting at the first item in the list. we simply move from item to item .following the underlying sequentail ordering until we either find what we are looking for or run out of item.if we run out of items we have discoverd that the item we were searching for was not present.
   > 2. complexity   o(n)
   >
2) > *Binary search*:
   >

   1) using to searching in sorted lists .we identify first and last item in list to identify middle item in last .if we found (item= middle_item) will return that found item .
   2) complexity   o(log n)
